#### Table creation code

``` sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
   Code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
   Name NVARCHAR NOT NULL ,
   Budget REAL NOT NULL 
 );
 
 CREATE TABLE Employees (
   SSN INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
   Name TEXT NOT NULL ,
   LastName VARCHAR NOT NULL ,--since question 2 asks about removing duplicate - text must be converted if the answer is using distinct
   Department INTEGER NOT NULL , 
   CONSTRAINT fk_Departments_Code FOREIGN KEY(Department) 
   REFERENCES Departments(Code)
 );
```
